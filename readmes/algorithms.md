# Algorithms
This module contains all the algorithms for detection.
It's divided in five independent parts :
|  |  |
|--|--|
| ***preprocess*** | image preprocessing functions (such as median filter)  |
| ***detection*** | all detection algorithms  |
| ***postprocess*** |  post process functions on the raw detection image  |
| ***thresholding*** | thresholding functions  |
| ***thresholding_postprocess*** | post process on thresholded image  |
