# STEPS

After you launch the game, you have to :

1. Chose 'Flight'

2. To chose a route, there's multiple ways

   - You can do a *right click* on and select your departure position and your arrival 

   - You also can *click* on the existing points of interest, 

     >Be careful by selecting a existing point, you can end up in a position with no speed etc (Ã  revoir !)

   - Or You can select them from the search bar

3. Chose your flight attitude in *navigation journal*

   >  Be careful (as 27/07/2021) the attitude doesn't account landforms, you can end up too close to the ground.

4. Select weather condition (can be changed via dev panel)

5. Select your plane (**the cruising speed is different from one another**)

6. Launch your flight, at the end of the loading, the game doesn't start directly it's paused. Press 'Resume??' 
   **The plane is on your control at the beginning, you have to set AI pilot first**

7. Menus are hidden unless you move your mouse, press **'Pause'** button.

8. Then select the **Control** section and check **AI pilot**
   
9. Now you have to unpause the game until the plane is on a stable speed, attitude and heading.<br>Unfortunatly sometime, the simulation starts at the opposite direction.

10. When everything is stable enough, **you can set your camera** 

11. Go to **Camera** section and set **Drone camera** (you'll see the camera pointing to the ground)

12. Close all ingame windows (Camera, AI pilot ...) and unpause the game.<br> **Becareful,** during the recording, you have to stand still and not move anything on your computer otherwise <br>your recording will be affected by theses changes.<br>Also **remove all windows overlaying your window game** for the same reasons above. 

13. Now on the recorder gui, start your recording or if you use a python script, launch it.  

14. We recording is finished, you'll have all your images and the planes values on the folder you specified .
